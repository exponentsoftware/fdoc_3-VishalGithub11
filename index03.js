// a. Imagine you are getting the above users collection from a MongoDB database.

// 	a. Create a function called ***signUp*** which allows user to add to the collection. If user exists, inform the user that he has already an account.
// 	b. Create a function called ***signIn*** which allows user to sign in to the application

// b. The products array has  three elements and each of them has six properties.

// 	a. Create a function called ***rateProduct*** which rates the product
// 	b. Create a function called ***averageRating*** which calculate the average rating of a product

// c. Create a function called ***likeProduct***. This function will helps to like to the product if it is not liked and remove like if it was liked.
